                        A little about myself,<br/><br/>
                        My name is Andrew Jirasek, I am a Full Stack Web Developer who attended UA Coding Bootcamp.
                        Growing up I've always had an interest in technology of any kind. I was pulled to web development because 
                        it was the perfect entry into programming and since then I've been working hard to develop my skills as much as possible.
                        I love front end design because design can have a huge impact on usability and how people percieve a product but I also have 
                        come to love the backend because its very satisfying to get everything working perfectly by thinking about all use cases.
